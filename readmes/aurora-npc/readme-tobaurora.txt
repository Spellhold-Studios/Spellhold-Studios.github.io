Aurora grew up in Athkatla, daughter of a minor merchant. She often traveled with her father's caravans when she was young, learning about shoes from her father and about swordplay from anyone who would teach her. Love of shoes might have kept her in the family business, but love of adventure drew her to travel, and as soon as she could, she joined a band of adventurers.

Ultimately, she was able to combine her two loves, enjoying adventure and collecting a large number of unique shoes (when she had the money). When it came time for her to settle, she didn't need to think hard about her new career: selling shoes. She may be retired, but she has lost none of her zest for life. She enjoyed her time as an adventurer immensely and now finds the same enjoyment in the settled life.

She watches her neighbors closely and has a hoard of gossip at her command. She’s also always willing to share stories of past adventures. Listening to them, you get the impression that she and her companions may not *always* have been quite as respectable as she now seems...

In SoA, Aurora is a non-joinable NPC, proprietor of Aurora's Shoes and Boots. She has plenty of gossip to share with he PC and a few more lengthy conversations. She also chats with the members of the PC's party. Currently, there are dialogs with all the Bioware NPCs and several mod NPCs.

She sells several unique items and asks the party to help locate several items she has lost during her travles.


Aurora NPC can be played with or without installing Aurora's Shoes and Boots. It assumes you've met her, and there's code for finding her items in ToB, but you don't *have* to do so.

Much of her soundset is voiced. We plan on adding Bioware-style voicing when RL releases berelinde for a while.
