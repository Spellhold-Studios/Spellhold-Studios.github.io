W_GUI beta 0.6b - a GUI replacement for Baldur's Gate 2 ToB, TUTU, Classic Adventures
Author: Kwiat_W (kwiatw.e[at]gmail.com)
Languages: Polish, English, Spanish, Russian, Italian, and French


Introduction:
-------------

After playing the same game for over ten years, it’s obvious that some players may be bored with the old brownish interface and the usual menu layout. This is mod for those who are tired of the current layout and who are not afraid to discover a new visual style. It’s still the same good old Baldur’s Gate 2, but in new shades of blue.

 W_GUI is a game modification that aims to completely redo the graphical user interface for Baldur’s Gate 2, BGTuTu and BGT. The mod works well with the bigg’s Widescreen Mod and includes new game fonts in different sizes, for those who play in high resolutions and think that original font is too small and hard to read. W_GUI also supports tweaks to the game interface made by Ascension64 ToBEx. 

The mod is in the beta phase of development but is mostly finished, and even in it’s current state replaces most of game’s interface seen during singleplayer.

W_GUI supports 800X600 and 1024X768 screen resolutions (but works also in higher resolutions with the Widescreen mod) in a single player game only.


Installation:
-------------

Other mods that make any changes to GUI (this includes TobEx) should be installed before this mod. The only exception is Widescreen mod, which should be installed after W_GUI.

Extract the RAR archive content into your BGII main directory. This is normally "C:\Program Files\Black Isle\BGII - SoA\".

Run "Setup-W_GUI.exe".

To reinstall or uninstall the mod, run Setup-W_GUI.exe again.
