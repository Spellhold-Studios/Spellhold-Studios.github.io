            This highly sophisticated yet conservative AI script automates tedious aspects of
            the game and leaves the cool stuff to the player. The script offers many configurable
            settings and provides lots of feedback. All class combinations and all of the NPCs
            are fully supported, so the script can be used by the entire party.</p>

                Once the file is in place, you can change your characters' scripts through their
                Character Record -> Customize -> Script. Simply choose <tt>XPARTY</tt> for all of
                them. It's a "one size fits all" script.</p>

            </h4>
            <ul>
                <p>
                    Press <b>[F]</b> to have the selected character(s) <b>[F]</b>ix damage. For the
                    next 120 seconds, healing spells will be cast on whoever needs it most until either
                    the spells run out or everyone is whole again. It is easiest to simply select the
                    entire party and press <b>[F]</b>.</p>
                <p>
                    Your party will speak the following lines:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><small><b>We need nothing at this time.</b></small>
                    (main character only): The party needs no healing.
                    <li><small><b>Healed</b></small>
                    (main character only): The party has been fully healed.
                    <li><small><b>Spell Cancelled: Can not target spells on invisible or sanctuaried creatures.</b></small>:
                    Spells (healing or otherwise) cannot be cast on this character because he or she
                    is (at least partially) invisible. Invisible healers can still heal themselves.
                    <li><small><b>Silenced</b></small>: This character is silenced. Just wait until
                    it wears off.
                    <li><small><b>Spell Failure</b></small>: This character is suffering from spell
                    failure. Just wait until it wears off.
                    <li><small><b>Healing</b></small>: This character started healing people.
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The script tries to heal the most damaged people first. Heal will be cast on the
                    really bad cases (people missing at least 50 hit points and/or at least 2/3 of their
                    hit points.) Mass Cure will be cast if at least two people are damaged. Cure Medium/Serious/Critical
                    Wounds will be cast if it seems warranted or if no lesser cure spell is available.
                    Cure Light Wounds (including the Bhaalpower) is considered expendable and will be
                    cast on anyone not at maximum hit points.</p>
                <p>
                    The script supports Monk's, Paladin's, and Mazzy's Lay On Hands, and will also cast
                    Wondrous Recall to recall healing spells. The script will also attempt to use the
                    Gloves of Healing as well. Make sure these gloves are not in a Bag of Holding.</p>
                <p>
                    Shapeshifters (such as Cernd) will shapeshift to their Natural Form if they can
                    shapeshift back when done. If they would not be able to shapeshift back, they will
                    say they're <small><b>Shapechanged</b></small>, and it'll be up to you. They'll
                    start doing their thing as soon as you manually order them to shapeshift back.</p>
                <p>
                    The party can also be configured to drink healing potions when ordered to heal.
                    See the <a href="#DrinkHealingPotions">Drink healing potions</a> section for details.</p>
            </ul>
            <h4>
                <a name="FightingStyle"><b>[S]</b>tyle (change fighting style)</a>
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <p>
                    Party cohesiveness is important in battles. A barbarian charging blindly at a lone
                    foe can draw the attention of many more enemies that were hidden in the fog of war.
                    A frail wizard charging mindlessly into melee is equally problematic. The script
                    allows you to configure each individual character to avoid drawing undue aggression.</p>
                <p>
                    Press <b>[S]</b> to have the selected character(s) change fighting <b>[S]</b>tyle.
                    The character(s) will select the next style and tell you about it:</p>
                <ul>
                    <h5>
                        Soldier</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <p>
                            The default style. This character will engage nearby opponents in melee and will
                            switch to a ranged weapon to shoot at distant foes. The character will prefer to
                            shoot enemies at a distance of 10 feet (which is 1/3 sight radius), but will join
                            the fray regardless of range if another party member is already engaged in melee.
                            This is a good all-round setting.</p>
                        <p>
                            If no ranged weapon is available, the character will recklessly charge the enemy
                            at any range. If you do not wish that to happen, either give them a ranged weapon
                            or set their style to Guard.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>
                        Archer</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <p>
                            This character will only use a ranged weapon. If an opponent tries to engage them
                            in melee, they'll temporarily switch to a melee weapon to avoid the gruesome penalties
                            for using a ranged weapon in melee and then backpedal a short distance before trying
                            again. This specialized setting is meant for dedicated archers and fragile mages.
                            Make sure they have a ranged weapon available at all times.</p>
                        <p>
                            Note that each time the character moves out of melee range, the opponent's initiative
                            is reset and if you're lucky the opponent will not be able to make an attack in
                            time.</p>
                        <p>
                            Characters unable to keep their distance (either because they're being chased or
                            because they're up against a wall) will periodically alert you to their predicament
                            by shouting <small><b>Help!!</b></small></p>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>
                        Guard</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <p>
                            This character will only engage nearby opponents in melee. If the nearest opponent
                            is more than 10 feet away, the character will simply do nothing unless another party
                            member is already engaged in melee. This is a specialized setting for dual wielders
                            (who can't switch to a ranged weapon) to keep them from breaking ranks. The character
                            will say <small><b>No! Stay back!</b></small> when holding the line this way. If
                            you wish them to engage, you'll have to manually order them to attack or move them
                            within 10 feet of the enemy.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>
                        Bard</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <p>
                            This character will sing, and will not attack. This style is only available to Bards.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>
                        Staff of the Magi</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <p>
                            People with the Staff of the Magi now have access to a special fighting style; <small>
                                <b>Staff of the Magi</b></small>. They'll try to stay invisible. The staff has
                            to be their most damaging melee weapon for this to work. This style will not work
                            if the character also has the Staff of Rynn or Staff of the Ram available, for instance,
                            since those are considered "more damaging."</p>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Anyone armed with Melf's Minute Meteors or Energy Blades will be unable to switch
                    to a melee weapon. As such, they will try to keep their distance regardless of their
                    style.</p>
            </ul>
            <h4>
                <a name="Bedtime"><b>[B]</b>edtime (cast long duration spells before resting)</a>
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <p>
                    Several spells last longer than the 8 hours it takes to rest. Ideally, the party
                    rises with all spells memorized <i>and</i> the maximum amount of stoneskins. Press
                    <b>[B]</b> to prepare the party for <b>[B]</b>edtime. They will cast the following
                    spells on themselves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    Melf's Minute Meteors (they last until used)
                    <li>
                    Stoneskin (from memory or the Gargoyle Boots) or Iron Skins (lasts 12 hours)
                    <li>
                    Armor (lasts 9 hours)
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Each of these spells will be cast once, regardless of how many meteors or skins
                    are still left, to make sure you start the next day with the full amount. Characters
                    will cast Wondrous Recall to get back Iron Skins if necessary.</p>
                <p>
                    Shapeshifters (such as Cernd) will shapeshift to their Natural Form if they can
                    shapeshift back when done. If they would not be able to shapeshift back, they will

                <p>
                    If any of your characters has Minor Sequencer, Spell Sequencer or Spell Trigger
                    memorized but does not have one active in their abilities menu, you will get a little
                    reminder; the character will say <small><b>Minor Sequencer</b></small>, <small><b>Spell
                        Sequencer</b></small> or <small><b>Spell Trigger</b></small> as appropriate.</p>

                    Press <b>[E]</b> to have the selected character(s) <b>[E]</b>xorcise undead. Whenever

                    again to stop, though you can usually just leave this on since the character(s)
                    will go about their business when no undead are around. The only time you actually
                    need to turn this off is when you are facing undead that you cannot turn and your
                    Cleric has to resort to old-fashioned violence.</p>
                <p>
                    Your character(s) will report their status by saying <small><b>Turning Undead</b></small>
                    or <small><b>Stopped Turning Undead</b></small> as appropriate.</p>
                <p>
                    Note that turning undead only has a 12 foot range. Characters will not attempt to
                    turn undead unless they get within 15 feet.</p>

                    Press <b>[V]</b> to have the selected character(s) <b>[V]</b>anish. They will not
                    engage enemies while hidden, though they will act normally once revealed. Use this
                    mode to scout ahead or to manually position characters for backstabbing. Press <b>[V]</b>
                    again to turn off stealth mode.</p>
                <p>
                    When backstabbing, once the character has revealed him- or herself, simply run out
                    of sight (either around the nearest corner or out of the enemy's sight radius) and
                    the character will immediately hide again. This allows you to dart in and out of
                    the shadows and backstab multiple times per combat.</p>
                <p>
                    Because spells cannot be cast on invisible people, hidden characters will leave
                    the shadows when ordered to heal unless they do not need any healing. Leaving the
                    shadows tends to take a while, though, so the script has hidden characters speak
                    to themselves to reveal themselves instantly. Improved invisible characters will
                    not reveal themselves, since they could still not be targeted anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    Note that characters trying to stay hidden cannot also look for traps, but with
                    a bit of fiddling you can temporarily get the best of both worlds. If you press
                    <b>[V]</b> to deactivate stealth mode, they'll immediately start to look for traps
                    but it'll take a while for them to leave the shadows. Press <b>[V]</b> again to
                    reactivate stealth mode before they become visible. Be careful, though; the amount
                    of time you have ranges from mere seconds to several rounds.</p>

                    characters at once. Characters will try to place at least one "tactical" trap (Special
                    Snare, Time Trap, Exploding Trap) and as many "damage" traps (Snare, Spike Trap)
                    as they can, though they will use whatever they have.</p>

                    will state each level as you cycle through them:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><small><b>Nothing</b></small>

                    Characters will drink anyting up to the specified type, so if you set it to Potions
                    of Extra Healing they'll also drink Potions of Healing. They'll start with the biggest
                    potions allowed. They will only drink a potion if they need at least half of the
                    healing the potion provides, so you don't have to worry about potions being wasted
                    on a character that just needed 1 hit point healed. The potions do not have to be
                    in the quickslots, and they will be taken out of a Potion Case or Bag of Holding
                    if necessary. Note that there is no need to keep potions in quickslots anyway, since
                    you can right-click them and drink them from the backpack.</p>
                <p>
                    Characters will pass potions to others that need them. Make sure your characters
                    have empty inventory slots available. Characters will not pass potions if they still
                    have Cure Light Wounds memorized, so if you wish your party to only use potions
                    when the healing spells run out, have your healer carry the potions.</p>

            <p>
                The script will defend itself in combat, and will automatically engage enemies in
                the manner appropriate to their combat style. The party will try to focus their
                attacks. Many variables affect their decisions, but they prefer finishing off wounded
                enemies and ignore disabled enemies (panicked, held, etcetera) until all the "live"
                enemies are dead.</p>
            <p>
                D&amp;D is not kind to ranged attackers, and Baldur's Gate is no exception. Creatures
                using a ranged weapon in melee suffer a whopping -8 to hit. Conversely, enemies
                attacking them in melee gain +4 to hit and +4 to damage. For this reason, the script
                rather anxiously switches to a melee weapon whenever an enemy comes near. It will
                also switch to a melee weapon before engaging in the modal actions of Hide In Shadows,
                Battle Song, and Turn Undead, since switching later would abort those actions.</p>
            <p>
                The party will try to stay together. Characters will not stand idle while while
                party members are beaten up just around the corner. For example, if Keldorn attacks
                an Ogre, and Minsc can see Keldorn but not the Ogre, Minsc will move to Keldorn.
                If you wish to have one character do all the work (such as when fighting Beholders
                with the Shield of Balduran), make sure to keep the others out of sight.</p>
            <p>
                In general, the script will try to stay out of your way. If you order a character
                to do something, the script will not interrupt except under these extremely specific
                and urgent circumstances:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Archers are allowed to attack when they come to the aid of a party member and spot
                their first enemy, to prevent the Archer from closing all the way in.
                <li>
                Ranged attackers are allowed to switch weapons when engaged in melee to avoid the
                hideous penalties for using a ranged weapon in melee.
                <li>
                Stoneskin is allowed to be re-cast straight away when the skins are depleted.

        <ul>
            <p>
                Thieves and Monks will automatically look for traps whenever they're not busy doing
                other things (such as hiding or fighting).</p>

                The script takes a minimalistic approach to spell and item use, and will only expend
                resources when it is almost certainly correct to do so.</p>
            <p>
                The script is aware that it cannot cast more than one spell every 6 seconds, and
                will not needlessly queue up spells. Instead, it will intelligently alternate between
                spellcasting and attacking. It will also not try to cast anything if silenced, or
                if there is a chance of spell failure or a wild surge.</p>
            <p>
                The script knows all about the Cowled Wizards. It will not cast spells in patrolled
                areas unless you have paid the bribe or crushed all of their patrols. The script
                knows exactly which areas are not patrolled, and will resume its normal duties as
                soon as you move off the streets.</p>
            <p>
                Charm and hold spells are situational and could be scripted to a sufficient degree
                of accuracy to let the script handle them. The exact circumstances in which the
                script will use these spells differ as appropriate. The script takes many variables
                into account, including the number and distance of opponents, their immunities,
                magic resistance and saving throws, and their hit points and Experience values.
                The script will use the following spells and items on suitable targets:</p>
            <ul>
                <h4>
                    Hold Person</h4>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        This spell has a small area, and the script will try to catch multiple enemies.</p>
                </ul>

                    Charm Animal (Ranger innate ability)</h4>

                    <p>
                        Rangers get this ability for free, but its application is extremely limited.</p>
                </ul>
                <h4>
                    Charm Person or Animal</h4>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        Druid spell selection is rather lacking in the level 2 slot, with only this and
                        Slow Poison being (barely) worth memorizing.</p>
                </ul>
                <h4>

                        Cast any time no iron skins remain. Unlike Stoneskin, this spell is too slow for
                        combat.</p>
                </ul>
                <h4>

                    <p>
                        Used after resting, any time no stoneskins remain and the boots still have a charge
                        left in them. Unlike the Stoneskin spell, the boots only give two skins and take
                        half a round to activate.</p>
                    <p>
                        The character does not actually have to be <i>wearing</i> the boots; they merely
                        need to be in the character's backpack.</p>

                    <p>
                        The character does not actually have to be <i>wearing</i> the girdle; it merely
                        needs to be in the character's backpack.</p>
                </ul>
                <h4>

                    <p>
                        Cast whenever 9 hours have passed. The script can't tell when Armor is active, so
                        it has to look at the clock.</p>

                        If your Druid plans to memorize neither of these spells, you may wish to rethink

                or Potion Case if needed. The party will also pass around Antidotes and Elixirs
                of Health. Characters prefer to use spells for curing others but antidotes for curing
                themselves (to avoid having their spell disrupted by the poison), though they will
                use what they can.</p>

            <p>
                I was rather involved in the Infinity Engine scripting scene a decade ago, writing
                Beholder AI for laughs and eventually working on the semi-official Ascension mod
                and the (never finished) Return to Windspear mod, after which I made the mistake
                of moving over to the (then still promising) Neverwinter Nights series.</p>
            <p>
                I initially wrote this script for my personal convenience. I decided to replay the
                series after ten years and I got tired of all the clicking I had to do to heal my
                party. One thing led to another. The script is tuned to my playstyle, which is evidenced
                in the heavy support for Stoneskin and Melf's Minute Meteors. I am a huge fan of
                dual- and multiclassed spellcasters. This is the first party I used:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Xixx (Kensai 13/Mage), (Sir) Anomen, Jaheira, Aerie, Jan, and Imoen replaced with
                Sarevok (dualled to Mage).
            </ul>
            <p>
                After that I decided to play a Thief to test the script under different circumstances,
                and so I added a lot of support for that as well. This was the second party:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Six (Kensai 13/Thief), Korgan, Viconia, Edwin, Yoshimo replaced with Imoen, and
                Sarevok (not dualled.)
            </ul>
            <p>
                After that I decided there were still a few character classes and NPCs that I hadn't
                tried, resulting in heavy support for Cernd's shapeshifting. This was the third
                party:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Xi-Xi (Monk), Minsc, Keldorn, Mazzy, Cernd, and Haer'Dalis.
            </ul>
        </ul>

                The script can't overwrite any existing files and should generally play nice with
                mods. Let me know if you suspect otherwise.</p>

        <ul>
            <p>
                Extreme care has been taken to fix all issues that could be fixed. The remaining
                issues remain because of limitations in the scripting engine. They are generally
                the product of a choice between two evils.</p>
            <p>
                The following issues are known:</p>
            <ul>
                <h4>
                    Overhealing</h4>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        Some care has been taken to reduce overhealing, but if you order multiple characters
                        to heal it is quite possible that several people will begin casting a healing spell
                        on a person that just needed one. Usually, only Cure Light Wounds gets wasted like
                        this. I consider this a minor inconvenience compared to the excessive mouse-clicking
                        that healing would otherwise require. It was either this or not allowing multiple
                        healers to go to work at the same time.</p>
                    <p>
                        It is also possible that if a character gets poisoned, several solutions are applied
                        at the same time.</p>
                </ul>
                <h4>
                    Healing precision</h4>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        Scripts cannot tell just how many hit points a character needs healed, but an approximation
                        can be made. This approximation may be off by a few points, especially on characters
                        with really low or really high hit point maximums.</p>
                </ul>
                <h4>
                    Characters milling around at end of combat</h4>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        Characters will go look for enemies when there's fighting going on just around the
                        corner. There is a slight delay before the script can see that the fight is actually
                        over, so the party will move around for a couple of seconds looking for more enemies
                        whenever a fight ends.</p>
                </ul>
                <h4>
                    The only slightly injured party</h4>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        There is a corner case where the party is only slightly injured and the only healing
                        available is reserved for serious cases. The Heal spell and healing potions will
                        not be wasted on a character that only needs 1 hit point healed. The script will
                        not report to be out of spells but there won't be any healing done either. It's
                        left up to you, though you will not receive any notification.</p>
                </ul>
                <h4>
                    The berserk mage (not the Berserker/Mage)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        The script can't tell whether the character has a ranged weapon, so it relies on
                        you for setting the correct combat style. If the character runs out of ammo (such
                        as a mage running out of darts), they'll rush into melee armed with their fists.
                        If they were set to the Archer style they'll then back off, but since they still
                        don't understand that they no longer have a ranged weapon they'll keep alternating
                        between backing off and rushing in. This problem is common to scripts. Check your
                        ammo.
                    </p>
                </ul>
                <h4>
                    Backpack overflow error</h4>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        If their backpack is full, characters that get potions passed their way (either
                        because they're poisoned or because they've been ordered to drink healing potions)
                        will drop the item in their top left backpack slot. If they get more than one type
                        of potion passed their way, they may even drop another item. Make sure there's room
                        in the backpacks if you order your party to pass potions around.</p>
                </ul>
                <h4>
                    Surplus potion passing</h4>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        Characters may end up with more potions than they need if they get passed potions
                        from several others at once. Potions can also be passed in stacks of up to 5. They
                        get passed one at a time from containers, but the game will pass the entire stack
                        from backpack slots or quickslots.</p>
                </ul>
                <h4>
                    The party has gained an item</h4>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        The script can't tell whether an item is inside a container (such as a Bag of Holding
                        or Potion Case). Items inside a container cannot be used, but that wouldn't stop
                        the script from trying. The workaround the script uses is to have the character
                        give the item to him- or herself before using it. This ensures the item is no longer
                        inside a container, so the script can't get hung up.</p>
                </ul>
                <h4>
                    &lt;GABBER&gt;- has nothing to say to you.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        Invisible characters that are asked to reveal themselves have to do so by talking
                        to themselves. This is the most expedient way of breaking invisibility. Waiting
                        for a hidden Thief to leave the shadows can take up to 20 seconds otherwise. This
                        attempt at conversation never results in actual dialog, but it does add a line saying
                        <small><b>&lt;GABBER&gt;- has nothing to say to you.</b></small> to the text area
                        (where GABBER is, of course, the name of the character.)</p>
                </ul>
                <h4>
                    The improved invisible non-self-healer</h4>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        Improved invisible creatures cannot be the target of spells or abilities from others,
                        but they can still target themselves. The targeting that the script uses when ordered
                        to heal does not take this into account. Doing so would increase its already considerable
                        complexity even further, and I'm not willing to go that far for such a corner case.
                        Improved invisibility cannot be broken at will, so improved invisible healers will
                        simply not cast any spells or use any targeted items on themselves.</p>
                    <p>
                        All is not lost, though. "Unimproved invisible" healers will reveal themselves and
                        then heal themselves normally. Improved invisible people will still drink potions,
                        and others will still pass potions to them.</p>
                </ul>
                <h4>
                    Using unusable items</h4>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        The script has trouble telling who can use what item, and no attempt has been made
                        to sort through the mess that is Baldur's Gate's "Usable by" versus "Unusable by"
                        item limitations. Don't give Gargoyle Boots to your Wizard Slayer! Unless he's a
                        Wizard Slayer/Thief with Use Any Item, of course.</p>
                    <p>
                        Note that the Gloves of Healing have undocumented limitations; they cannot be used
                        by single-classed Clerics, Druids or Mages (including Sorcerers), but are usable
                        by all multiclass variants (including even Cleric/Mage.) You'll notice that they
                        have a reddish tint if their current owner can't use them.</p>
                    <p>
                        For most other cases, it should be obvious when this happens.</p>
                </ul>
                <h4>
                    Virtual healing potions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        The script will use healing potions in quickslots if ordered to do so. A strange
                        engine glitch may cause these potions to still appear in the quickslot even after
                        they are used up. These virtual potions cannot be used and do not cause any problems;
                        it just looks weird.</p>
                </ul>
                <h4>
                    Armed monks</h4>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        If you give a Monk a melee weapon, the script will equip it even if the Monk would
                        be better off using his or her fists. The game mistakenly thinks the weapon would
                        do more damage.</p>
                </ul>
                <h4>
                    Blurred Blades</h4>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        The script cannot tell the difference between a Blade in Defensive Spin and a Blade
                        that cast Blur. The script will assume that a blurred Blade is in Defensive Spin,
                        and will select weapons and targets accordingly.</p>
                </ul>
                <h4>
                    Bouncing healers</h4>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        Healers will attempt to heal characters protected by (Minor) Spell Deflection/Turning/Trap,
                        with predictable results. These protections cannot be accurately detected by the
                        script. Move any problem characters out of sight when ordering the script to heal.</p>

                I might well be the last person to have written a script, but I wasn't the first.

            <p>
                Both of those script series are excellent work, but they try to do far too much
                for my liking. I also believe my script is smarter in what it does do.</p>

                    thing these babies will not punch through is Protection from Magical Weapons. Stoneskin
                    only slows them down (the fire damage still gets through and they eat five skins
                    per round regardless), and Spell Turning only reflects a negligible part of their
                    damage (while at the same time being depleted rapidly.) Their high rate of fire
                    makes them excellent for filling the gaps between spellcasting.</p>

                <p>
                    I love me some clone spell abuse. Project Image and to a lesser extent Simulacrum
                    can double up on your spellbook and your "one use per day" items, and give you a
                    virtually infinite supply of "one use ever" items. Clones also ignore the limits
                    on summoned creatures.</p>
                <p>
                    I save all the Time Stop and Wish scrolls I find for cloning, never writing them
                    into my spellbook. I also keep the Mind Flayer Control Circlets and some Scrolls
                    of Protection from Undead. Aerie's clones can cast Greater Restoration, healing
                    the entire party without fatiguing Aerie herself. Jan's clones can set Spike Traps,
                    though they do not ignore the trap limit. They can also summon multiple planetars
                    and devas. A clone with the Rod of Resurrection can heal the entire party, and a
                    clone with the Wand of Monster Summoning can generate <i>ridiculous</i> amounts
                    of fodder.</p>
            </ul>
            <h4>
                <a name="Summons">Back off</a>
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <p>
                    I have the game set to Auto-Pause: Enemy Sighted, and if I run into enemies I usually
                    back off immediately. This can give you a lot of time to prepare. Chances are they
                    haven't even noticed the party, especially if the person to spot them is wearing
                    Boots of Speed. Get the party into position, buff up, or send in the summons.</p>
                <p>
                    This tactic is especially effective against mages; they can't cast spells on what
                    they can't see, and they're often too busy casting defensive spells to go after
                    you. Dodging back through an area transition will also waste whatever spells they
                    try to throw at you. Often they&#39;ll even cast Gate and then attack their own
                    Pit Fiend.</p>
            </ul>
            <h4>

            <ul>
                <p>
                    When it is obvious that there is a fight ahead, simply summon some sturdy minions,
                    send in your army and sit back. I finished many big fights without actually showing
                    up myself. You can cast Wizard Eye or Farsight if you wish to view the spectacle,
                    but often that isn't even needed unless you include clones.

                    A Nishruu or the Skeleton Warrior you get from Animate Dead once you're level 15
                    can clear out a room on its own if it doesn't run into Death Spell. Both of these
                    are practically immune to magic and unenchanted weapons.</p>
                <p>

                <li>
                Improved: Sneakers stop trying to hide in front of invisible enemies (which allows
                them to resume trapfinding and with that Detect Illusions.)

                speak their "Why do you waste my time with idle banter?" line. How's that for a
                corner case? New: Characters now give a little reminder whenever a Minor/Spell Sequencer/Trigger
                can be cast.
                <li>New: Added <b>[N]</b>o AI HotKey, an individual AI toggle that stops the script
                for the selected character only. Still allows for HotKey configuration.

                New: Rangers now automatically use Charm Animal.

                New: People with the Staff of the Magi now have access to a special fighting style;
                Staff of the Magi. They'll try to stay invisible.
                <li>
                New: Shapeshifters in Werewolf or Greater Werewolf form will now shapeshift to their
                natural form when ordered to heal, and shapeshift back when done.
                <li>
                Improved: No longer cast Melf's Minute Meteors while in "Staff of the Magi style".

                Improved: A main character in stealth mode will no longer hide twice in a row when
                saying "Healed". Just once, now, after.

                Improved: Characters no longer speak a line when passing a potion.
                <li>

                    <b>[B]</b>edtime.
                <li>
                Improved: No longer cast any spells if there is a chance of a wild surge.

                <li>
                Improved: Poisoned characters will now try to drink antidotes before casting spells
                to cure their condition.
                <li>Improved: Characters may now speak a line when given certain orders:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>[F]</b>ix (main character only)
                        <li><b>[B]</b>edtime (main character only)
                        <li><b>[E]</b>xorcise (different when toggled on or off)
                    </ul>
                    <li>

                party member is already engaged in melee.
                <li>
                Improved: People unable to move about now select weapons and targets appropriately.
                <li>
                Improved: Healers now double-check their targets after moving to them to avoid overhealing.
                <li>Improved: Script should interrupt the player even less now, only under these conditions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        Archers may interrupt when they come to the aid of a party member and spot their
                        first enemy, to prevent the Archer from closing all the way in.
                        <li>
                        Ranged attackers will switch weapons when engaged in melee to avoid the hideous
                        penalties for using a ranged weapon in melee.
                        <li>
                        Stoneskin will be re-cast straight away when the skins are depleted.
                    </ul>
                    <li>Improved: Containers no longer snap shut on sneaky people trying to loot straight
                        after combat.</li>
                <li>Improved: The script will no longer interrupt the player except in very specific
                    and urgent circumstances. See <a href="#CombatAI">Combat AI</a>
                for details.
                <li>Changed: <b>[N]</b>uke is now <b>[K]</b>illzone.
                <li>
                Changed: Stealth mode is no longer available to people that can't Hide In Shadows
                but have the Staff of the Magi. Use the Staff of the Magi style for that.

                    <li>
                    Fix: The party no longer has to be outnumbered for the script to cast charm or hold
                    spells.
                    <li>

                    New: The script now automatically uses the Ring of Human Influence on suitable targets.
                    <li>
                    Improved: Druids no longer bother casting Charm Person or Mammal while silenced,
                    poisoned or risking spell failure or wild surge.
                    <li>
                    Improved: Rangers now wait for animals to get a little closer before they try to
                    charm them.
                    <li>
                    Improved: If the party is attacked while healing, they will now stop healing until
                    the fight is over.
                    <li>
                    Improved: Archers will not call for help until they actually fail to keep their
                    distance.
                    <li>
                    Improved: Cernd will no longer shapeshift to heal or prep if he can't shift back.
                    Instead he'll say "Shapechanged". Just order him to shift manually, and he'll go
                    do what he's supposed to.
                    <li>
                    Improved: Script no longer takes a second to respond after disengaging stealth mode,
                    turn undead mode, or the AI cutoff.
                    <li>
                    Improved: Slightly improved the feedback given by shapechanged characters when ordered
                    to heal or prep.
                    <li>
                    Improved: Slightly tweaked charm spell thresholds.
