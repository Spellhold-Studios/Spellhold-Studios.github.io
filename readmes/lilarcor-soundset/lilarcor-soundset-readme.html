            This is Lilarcor, the homicidal talking sword with a one-track mind. You know him,
            you love him! Now available as a soundset for an equally homicidal player character
            with a one-track mind, with full support for thieving skills and everything.</p>
        <p>
            Thoroughly tested by yours truly. I did my best to avoid annoying repetitions and
            I think it turned out rather well, though Lilarcor obviously isn't for everyone.
            I tested with a Thief, which is important because an annoying Hid In Shadows sound
            gets old really fast if you use a script that keeps your character hidden.</p>

            Most of these sounds are pure, unadulterated Lilarcor lines, but some are clips

                I was rather involved in the Infinity Engine scripting scene a decade ago, writing
                Beholder AI for laughs and eventually working on the semi-official Ascension mod
                and the (never finished) Return to Windspear mod, after which I made the mistake
                of moving over to the (then still promising) Neverwinter Nights series.</p>
        </ul>

                These versions weren't released to the public. Much. Anyway, I forgot the details,
                but overall I made things less grating on the ears.
