            This is Jon Irenicus, the megalomanic, arrogant bad guy we all know and love, voiced
            by none other than David Warner. Now available as a soundset for an equally megalomanic,
            arrogant player character, with full support for thieving skills and everything.</p>
        <p>
            Thoroughly tested by yours truly. I did my best to avoid annoying repetitions and
            at the same time pay proper homage to the classics. I think it turned out rather
            well, though Jonny didn't offer a whole lot of options for some of the sounds. I
            went through each and every Irenicus sound file in the game, rather meticulously.
            I tested with a Monk, which is important because an annoying Hid In Shadows sound
            gets old really fast if you use a script that keeps your character hidden.</p>

            Most of these sounds are clipped from Jonny's lengthier speeches, though several
            are straight from the horse's mouth. One particular sound (Tired) has been cut-and-pasted
            together.</p>

                I was rather involved in the Infinity Engine scripting scene a decade ago, writing
                Beholder AI for laughs and eventually working on the semi-official Ascension mod
                and the (never finished) Return to Windspear mod, after which I made the mistake
                of moving over to the (then still promising) Neverwinter Nights series.</p>
