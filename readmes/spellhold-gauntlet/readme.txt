Spellhold Gauntlet 
Version 1.16

1. Introduction

An extra apparition shows up in the area where you have a chance to pick up Imoen. It offers a simple alternative to the complicated puzzles and tests and levels that the Spellhold Maze offers - the Spellhold Gauntlet.

The Spellhold Gauntlet is a series of trials meant to test your limits, both your mettle and your resource management. If you survive you probably have considerable focus of both mind and body. In this chamber you shall be in the centre of the room and be continuously set upon by waves of enemies, and you will receive tokens in return for defeating each wave. 

These tokens can be used in exchange for
- opportunity to rest between waves
- random items of varying power; if you wish to select unique items you will need to spend more tokens
- unique spell scrolls that can be found within Spellhold
- your freedom to leave the Gauntlet and move on directly to Judgment
- immediately leave the Gauntlet and move on to the riddles portion of the Spellhold Tests

This mod aims to fulfill a few aims
- *NEW* : SPELLHOLD-BE-GONE, a seamless route for those who wish it
- provide a simple, accelerated route through Spellhold for players replaying it for the umpteenth time 
- provide items that most players feel are too good to miss in Spellhold
- *NEW* : provide scrolls that Spellhold area provides
- providing combative challenges to those who choose the harder waves
- providing XP comparable to the original route, or even more, depending on the difficulty of the waves
- providing an almost limitless stream of potential magic items (non-unique) for those who have the mettle to battle on in the Gauntlet

Note that the longer you remain in the Gauntlet the more dangerous it will become, but the greater the rewards you have a chance of gleaning. Remember, plan your moves wisely and use your token resources well. 

You have been warned.



EXTRA COMPONENT - Irenicus Waiting in Spellhold

If you chose to come in by being incarcerated in Spellhold, the Coordinator will be waiting at the end of one of the halls for you, rather than you having to wait for him to arrive.


EXTRA COMPONENT - Shortened Spellhold Cutscenes and Dream

Irenicus' casts his spell on Imoen and yourself much faster, killing all the thieves at once. In the dream, Bhaal is found inside of candlekeep, and you are teleported directly to in front of the demon guarding the passageway in, saving time.


EXTRA COMPONENT - Interjections for Spellhold Gauntlet (dialogue by Liam)

Interjections provided by Liam / Kaeloree. Coding done by Zyraen. Quite a few of these will typically fire off during the waiting time between waves or when particular monster(s) appear.



2. Gameplay Notes

In order to enter the Gauntlet, when Bodhi leaves the party while in the Spellhold maze, an apparition is spawned inside of the maze not far from where Imoen is waiting. This apparition will wait only for 4 rounds (about 24 seconds) before vanishing, and can be talked to as many times as you wish.

Within the Gauntlet, the party starts in a crossroads of 4 pathways. Before each wave, every party member MUST be within this centre area. If they are outside of it, the spectre will teleport everyone to his position in the centre, before the wave begins. So if you wish to maintain a certain defensive formation, make sure that you are within a certain radius of the spectre.

Between each wave is a time interval of 3 rounds (18 seconds), which can be used for buffing up, healing, etc. Alternatively you may speak to the spectre to cause the next wave to arrive right away. You may only make one request of the spectre per wave. 

Each wave generally comes from 4 directions, with each pathway spawning different creatures, but which corridor spawns which monsters is randomised. There will also be situations where monsters spawn in the middle of the battle.

After entering the Gauntlet, the player may choose to leave for the Riddle portion of Spellhold Tests, or to move straight on to judgment. 

The Gauntlet also is a place where players can experience standard interjection points like Bodhi showing up to hunt the PC and the PC's Slayer Transformation while Resting. 

This mod is compatible with all other Mods, because the route is entirely optional. For those playing Mods that have content in Spellhold, they can choose not to go to the Gauntlet. 

EXTRAS

If you pick the Ultimate Challenge to effectively have a Spellhold-Be-Gone, you will gain all the items and scrolls in Spellhold all at once, 75K XP awarded to each player, as well as 25 tokens required to meet Bodhi and leave the Gauntlet. However, be prepared to face considerable opposition (albeit nothing that cannot be resolved by CTRL-Y)



3. Release Notes

Some of the following might be areas to look out for

- the difficulty of the battles : are the battles too difficult? Is it reasonable for an average player to obtain 25 tokens without being killed? are the battles too easy? Are the final wave battles too easy so that players will take staying in there too lightly, to keep remaining there for easy XP ?

- the positioning : it should be impossible for any party members to be outside of the centre of the Gauntlet when a wave begins - after a wave begins they may roam freely. Please save a screenshot if you find that a certain position allows a player or two to be outside of the radius of the centre as the wave begins

Those who are using imported characters with items should take note that they do not have these duplicate items, or the Spectre will leave.

OTHER COMPONENTS

A) Irenicus Waiting in Spellhold

Overview
If you choose to be an inmate in Spellhold, you do not have to wait for hours before Irenicus shows up. He now teleports in on his own after Lonk has opened all the gates for the prisoners. Irenicus awaits at the southern end of the holding area, near Dradeel, and will not interrupt the player's activities. When the player wishes to, the party may either 
1) attack Irenicus 
2) walk near to him, causing him to speak
in order to advance the story. 


B) Shortened Spellhold Cutscenes and Dream

Overview
This mod does a few time-saving activities in Spellhold, by doing TWO things

1) drastically cuts down the time Irenicus takes to cast the spell on Imoen and yourself to rip the Bhaalspawn soul essence from you. It does so by simply killing all the thieves at once.

2) in your dream, it moves Bhaal into the Candlekeep castle itself. It also teleports you in front of the demon so that you don't have to waste time moving over. This is meant to cut down the time spent trying to lead that slow moving Bhaal to Imoen.
