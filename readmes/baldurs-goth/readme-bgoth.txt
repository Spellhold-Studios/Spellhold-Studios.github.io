~ BALDUR'S GOTH - v2 ~

==========================

  A Baldur's Gate II Mod


+) Section 1. About
===================
  Baldur's Goth is a mod which enhances the graphical side of Baldur's Gate, in an attempt to make the game more "Gothy". This includes edited portraits and paperdolls of all NPCs, as well as a new startup screen for both SoA and ToB.

  Baldur's Goth has support for Throne of Bhaal, but the expansion is not required.

  Version 2 combines the previously separate Baldur's Goth II, Baldur's Goth Expansion Pack, and Cross Goth in a single mod package.


+) Section 1.1 Baldur's Goth Expansion Pack
  =========================================
  On the original Baldur's Goth thread, Sidhe requested versions of the Bioware NPCs without red lipstick. Dymphna created some great alternate portraits, and options are always a good thing. Then I browsed though the forum a bit more. I found her Jaheria without the lipring, and her Saervok without the red glowing eyes. I thought, why not include these? This also seemed to be a good place to toss in my alternate Jaheria. Suddenly my second mod was under work (Yes I started this and left it unfinished for a long time).


+) Section 1.2 Cross Goth
  =======================
  This is an attempt to make the modded NPCs more "goth" and fit in more with the original Baldur's Goth mod. This version features edited portraits and paperdolls for a small number of the modded NPCs for Baldur's Gate II.


+) Section 2. Installation
==========================
  Baldur's Goth is a WeiDU mod, which can be installed before or after any other WeiDU mod. Official patches and non-WeiDU mods should be installed prior to all WeiDU mods, including Baldur's Goth.

  Cross Goth components will only work if the desired modded NPC is installed first.

  The mod has the following component groups:

  Baldur's Goth II
  ================
   NPC Enhancements
     This component will add new portraits and change the paperdoll colours for all joinable Bioware NPCs, including Sarevok for ToB, as well as for Jon Irenicus.

     You can choose to install the portraits separately or with changed paperdoll colours. The latter is recommended for full experience.

   New Main Screen Images
     This component will change both the SoA and the ToB main screens.

  Baldur's Goth Expansion Pack
  ============================
  There are several components and multipule portraits for each of the NPCs. This is a beta (but working) release of a project aiming to expand the portrait options of the original Baldur's Goth. Currently it does not contain updated paperdoll colors; this was a rush release to get it out for Samhain/Halloween.

  Kiyone & Kova from Beyond the Law
    This Mod introduces 2 new NPCs to the BG2 Gaming Experience: Kova, a mage/thief with an unsavoury background and good heart (or so he claims), and Kiyone, a law-enforcing, impartial (or so she claims) archer. This Mod looks into proving one man's innocence against the odds, and highlights the unlikely yet strong bond formed between the two people, so different yet so much alike. - http://forums.spellholdstudios.net/index.php?showforum=325

  Kari the Kobold (pierced and without piercings)
    Kari, the young and innocent half-kobold girl, offspring of a human father, a cleric of Sune, and a kobold mother. She will probably remind you of Aerie, but she won't toss her problems in your face. - http://chosenofmystra.net/forums/viewforum.php?f=68
