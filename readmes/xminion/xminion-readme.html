            Several important summoned creatures have had their AI considerably improved. These
            creatures will now attempt to use all their abilities where appropriate, with some
            thought put into target selection regarding resistances and immunities, and will
            alternate between spellcasting and attacking for maximum efficiency. The enhancements
            apply only to creatures controlled by the party; these scripts do not make enemies
            smarter.</p>
        <p>
            All of the enhanced creatures will greet their master when summoned by saying: <small>
                <b>I serve only &lt;PRO_LADYLORD&gt; &lt;CHARNAME&gt;!</b></small> (filling
            in the variables, of course), with the exception of the elemental princes, who retain
            their own lines.</p>
        <h3>
            <a name="Spells">Spells</a>
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <p>
                The scripts are extremely careful with spells that have been deemed "unsafe", such
                as Fireball, Globe of Blades or Dispel Magic. Unsafe spells will only automatically
                be cast when there is no risk of collateral damage. Manually order your creatures
                to cast these spells if you wish to use them.</p>
            <p>
                Several creatures have the same set of spells. This is the Ogre Mage list, and some
                of the other creatures likely ended up with this list due to sloppy copy/pasting
                by the game's developers. These spells are nevertheless put to good use. The list
                includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Agannazar's Scorcher: Somewhat unsafe, to be cast only when no party members are
                in sight.
                <li>
                Melf's Acid Arrow and Magic Missile: Fast and practical.
                <li>
                Stinking Cloud and Lightning Bolt: Deemed too unsafe for scripted use.
                <li>
                Ghost Armor: A quick buff.
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        <a name="TheCreatures">The creatures</a>

    <ul>
        <h3>
            <a name="Planetar">Planetar and Fallen Planetar (from Summon Planetar and Summon Dark
                Planetar)</a>
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <p>
                The planetars are excellent fighters and spellcasters. They have a long list of
                spells, but because they are so fearsome in melee (average 84 damage against AC
                0) they will forego many of these spells in favor of simply cutting their opponents
                to ribbons. They will cast the following spells:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Remove Fear: To be cast at the earliest possible opportunity, preemptively when
                facing liches (who just love casting Time Stop into Symbol, Fear) or dragons, curatively
                on panicked party members and proactively when summoned outside of combat (since
                it lasts a whole hour). Celestial beings or not, they are not immune to fear.
                <li>
                Insect Plague: To be cast on spellcasters.
                <li>
                Magic Missile: To be cast on stoneskinned enemies.
                <li>
                Symbol, Death and Symbol, Fear: Powerful but very slow, so the risk of the spell
                being disrupted is huge. Cast only on particularly vulnerable enemies.
                <li>
                Holy Word: A bit of a corner case, hardly worth trying, and somewhat unsafe.
                <li>
                Flame Arrow: The planetar is a level 25 spellcaster, so this deals considerable
                damage.
                <li>
                Cure Poison: Cast outside of combat on poisoned party members or self as required.
                <li>
                Heal: Cast on wounded party members outside of combat (it is too slow to cast while
                the battle still rages.)
                <li>
                True Seeing and Improved Invisibility: Cast outside of combat, as preparation.
            </ul>
            <p>
                Dispel Magic, Earthquake, Globe of Blades and Firestorm were deemed too risky for
                scripted use. Chaos and Flame Strike were ignored because they pale in comparison
                to the planetar's hack and slash damage output. Cure Disease, Raise Dead, Remove
                Curse and Restoration cannot be scripted. Unholy Word is useless since enemies are
                almost never Good aligned. Detect Invisibility is pointless since planetars can
                see invisible creatures anyway and have True Sight to dispel illusions.</p>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            <a name="Deva">Deva and Fallen Deva (from Summon Deva and Summon Fallen Deva)</a>
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <p>
                The devas are good fighters and spellcasters, though not as awesome as the planetars.
                Their script has the following features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Remove Fear: To be cast at the earliest possible opportunity, preemptively when
                facing liches or dragons, curatively on panicked party members and proactively when
                summoned outside of combat.
                <li>
                Cure Poison: Cast on poisoned party members or self as required.
                <li>
                Cure Critical Wounds: Cast on wounded party members outside of combat (it is too
                slow and inconsequential to cast while the battle still rages.)
            </ul>
            <p>
                Globe of Blades was deemed too risky. Cure Disease and Remove Curse cannot be scripted
                (and hardly matter anyway.) A bug in their spell list prevents them from casting
                their Chaos spell (which would have been decent) and their third Globe of Blades
                spell.</p>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            <a name="Chan">Chan, Elemental Prince of Air (from Greater Elemental Summoning)</a>
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <p>
                Chan now uses his Whirlwind, which appears to be a sort of Ring of the Ram thing.</p>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            <a name="ZaamanRul">Zaaman Rul, Elemental Prince of Fire (from Greater Elemental Summoning)</a>
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <p>
                Zaaman Rul now uses his superfast Flame Strike.</p>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            <a name="Efreeti">Efreeti (from the Efreeti Bottle)</a>
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <p>
                The efreeti is a decent fighter and has several useful spells, even though it is
                only a low-level spellcaster. It has the Ogre Mage list described above, and on
                top of that a Flame Strike and a Flame Arrow. Ghost Armor is not scripted since
                it would not improve the efreeti's AC anyway.</p>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            <a name="Nishruu">Nishruu (from Summon Nishruu)</a>
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <p>
                The Nishruu has the Ogre Mage spell list, which it uses to good effect even though
                its primary purpose is soaking up enemy spells. It now casts Ghost Armor right after
                being summoned, a quick spell that greatly improves the nishruu's AC.</p>
            <p>
                The hakeashar (from Summon Hakeashar) also uses this script. However, since the
                hakeashar is only a minimal upgrade from the nishruu and there are stupidly powerful
                spells available at its level, it is a waste of a spell slot.</p>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            <a name="Nymph">Nymph (from Call Woodland Beings)</a>
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <p>
                This lady is rather frail in combat (despite her startling 7 attacks per round),
                but has an impressive array of spells:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mass Cure: Cast if there are at least two wounded party members, counting the nymph
                    herself, or as a parting gift at the last second before she vanishes. She'll announce
                    this by saying: <small><b>I must be going now.</b></small>
                <li>
                Call Lightning: Cast when fighting outdoors.
                <li>
                Mental Domination, Hold Monster, Hold Person and Confusion: Cast on anything it
                could affect.
                <li>
                Miscast Magic: Cast on spellcasters. Not a very impressive spell, though.
                <li>
                Cause Serious Wounds: Cast when the nymph has nothing else left, kamikaze style.
            </ul>
            <p>
                The nymph will try to stay out of trouble as long as she still has relevant spells
                to cast, but will chip in with the occasional punch if she's next to something that
                isn't immune to her unenchanted fists.</p>
            <p>
                Note that the nymph instantly casts Barkskin on herself when she sees an enemy.
                This is not a new feature, and it does not interfere with her other spellcasting.</p>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            <a name="Kitthix">Kitthix (from the Black Spider Figurine)</a>
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <p>
                Kitthix will now fire its Web Tangle at vulnerable enemies, and will teleport around
                slightly more intelligently.</p>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            <a name="Cerebus">Cerebus (from the Moon Dog Figurine)</a>
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <p>
                Cerebus' original script was quite flawed, redundantly casting Mirror Images three
                times in a row before attacking. This old dog has been taught several new tricks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Moon Dog Howl: Used to cause fear.
                <li>
                Moon Dog Sight: Used to reveal invisible enemies, and to dispel Mirror Images and
                Improved Invisibility. It can only dispel illusions of level 5 or lower, so it is
                useless against Mislead.
                <li>
                Mirror Image: Used whenever no images remain. Cerebus can take quite the beating
                now.
                <li>
                Improved Invisibility: Used to improve its AC. It cannot cast this on others anyway.
                <li>
                Healing Lick: Used to cure poison and heal damage.
            </ul>

                I was rather involved in the Infinity Engine scripting scene a decade ago, writing
                Beholder AI for laughs and eventually working on the semi-official Ascension mod
                and the (never finished) Return to Windspear mod, after which I made the mistake
                of moving over to the (then still promising) Neverwinter Nights series.</p>

                I might well be the last person to have written a script, but I wasn't the first.
                You may or may not like these other scripts better:</p>

                <li><a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/cirerrek/gminion.php">gMinion</a>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, the gMinion download link is broken... but I believe that my minions
                        are slightly smarter anyway (the ones I wrote scripts for, at least.)</p>

                    When it is obvious that there is a fight ahead, simply summon some sturdy minions,
                    send in your army and sit back. I finished many big fights without actually showing
                    up myself. You can cast Wizard Eye or Farsight if you wish to view the spectacle,
                    but often that isn't even needed unless you include clones.

                    A Nishruu or the Skeleton Warrior you get from Animate Dead once you're level 15
                    can clear out a room on its own if it doesn't run into Death Spell. Both of these
                    are practically immune to magic and unenchanted weapons.</p>
                <p>
                    I consider these summon spells worth memorizing, in order of awesomeness:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    Summon Planetar or Fallen Planetar (Wizard)

                    Spider Summoning (level 12+ Wizard for Swords Spiders)

                <li>
                Fix: Chan will now check his target's crushing damage resistance instead of fire

                <li>
                New: Added Cerebus, from the Moon Dog Figurine. This old dog has been taught many

                <li>
                Improved: Planetars and Zaaman Rul no longer get hung up on attacking, so they will
