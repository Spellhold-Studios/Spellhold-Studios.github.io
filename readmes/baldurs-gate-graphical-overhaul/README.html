                <h2>Overview</h2><br>

                <p>
                    This mod is probably the biggest visual overhaul of the game since it was released. It reinstates the extended night areas that are missing from <strong>all</strong> main areas. Now, when you open doors at night they show light from inside the building. Buildings actually have windows that are lit up. 
					Many night maps have their own lighting map and interiors are equipped with candles, torches and lights.<br>
					
					As luck would have it, two met by chance in the Beamdog and Gibberlings 3 forums, respectively. The thanks here goes to Jastey. 
					One was trying to deal with all the problems of the two versions not working properly for both engine variants. The other was just tweaking and beautifying the graphics further. 
					Fortunately, when they finally got in contact, there was an incredible synergy effect. They understood each other right away and joined forces.
					Not only were all the old graphics from BG1 reworked, but they also decided to add all the areas from BG2, ToB, SoD, BG1EE and BG2EE without the original night map.
					This means that there are now 83 new night maps. In total 636 maps will be improved.
					These are the night maps and also day maps. Light maps are added, graphical bugs are fixed, animated water areas are added, animated candles, torches and lights are added.
					Especially with the animated candles, torches and lights, old maps can be improved at any time.

                <p style="margin-top:2%;">
                    <em>If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-mymod.exe&nbsp;</span></strong>, un-install all previously installed components and delete the üìÅ mymod folder.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>When installing or un-installing, <strong>do not close the <acronym title="Console application like Command Prompt, Windows Terminal, macos Terminal, Linux Shell etc">Console</acronym> window</strong> by clicking on the <strong>X</strong> button! Instead, press the <strong>Enter</strong> key whenever instructed to do so.</em>

                <p>
                    <strong>Disable any antivirus</strong> or other 
memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some 
(particularly Avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false 
positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.

                <h3>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG</h3>

                <p style="margin-top:2%;">
                    Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the 
additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must run a program called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases/latest">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod.

                <p style="margin-top:2%;">
                    The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. 
Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If
 in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update
 (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be 
able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole 
game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched 
by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the 
language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues 
of the mod will not show but give error messages.

                    Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify (<em>the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file</em>).

To install, double-click <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-mymod.command&nbsp;</span></strong> and follow the instructions on screen.
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    Download the latest Linux version of <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases"><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym></a> and copy weidu, weinstall and tolower to /usr/bin. Then open a terminal and <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;cd&nbsp;</span></strong> to your game installation directory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Optional: run 'tolower' and answer 'Y' to both 
queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've 
already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is 
already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option 
(lowercasing file names) either, if you've extracted only this mod since
 the last time you lowercased file names. If unsure, running tolower and
 choosing both options is the safe bet.</em>

                    Run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;weinstall setup-mymod&nbsp;</span></strong> in your game folder to install the mod.

                <h2>Troubleshooting</h2><br>

                <p>
                    These are some general tips if you have problems 
getting the game working, with or without this or other mods. Many 
times, errors have to do with the game engine itself or the manner of 
installation or gameplay. The game recommends deleting all files out of 
the /cache, /temp and /tempsave üìÅ sub-folders in your game folder to 
see if that resolves the problem before any further troubleshooting.
                </p><br>

                <hr style="width: 90%;"><br>

                <p>
                    <strong>Symptom: Game freezes or crashes to desktop (CTDs)</strong>
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Sometimes the game displays an "assertion error" in a
 pop-up window when this happens, but often times it doesn't. To enable 
the full error message, open the file <strong>baldur.ini</strong> in 
your game folder with a text editor (such as Notepad). If you find you 
can't edit it or save changes in Windows Vista or 7, see <a href="http://forums.bioware.com/viewtopic.html?topic=662080&amp;forum=10">this topic</a> for assistance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under the [Program Options] section in the file, type <strong>Logging On=1</strong> (unless it's already there). While you're there, you may also want to make sure <strong>Debug Mode=1</strong> is there to enable the <a href="https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/appendices/clua/bg2.htm">CLUA Console</a>
 for debugging and testing. Save the file and exit. Now go back into the
 game and try to reproduce the crash. Then look in your game folder 
again for the <strong>Baldur.err</strong> file and open it with a text editor to analyse its contents.
                </p><br>

                <hr style="width: 90%;"><br>

                <p>
                    <strong>Symptom: Game crashes with no Baldur.err log

                <p>
                    This usually indicates an animation-related issue. 
Make sure you have the latest version of the mod. If you've installed 
other mods after it and have this issue, install the fix available <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/files/file/884-ia-aurora-low-fix/">here</a>.

                    Less-than-informative messages like these may 
indicate you're installing to a hard drive with a low data transfer rate
 or an antivirus program is active during installation (which can also 
affect data transfer). Try installing to an internal drive with 
antivirus protection disabled during the install. If unsure, disconnect 
from the Internet (either unplug your network cable or disable your 
wireless adaptor) and turn off <strong>all</strong> memory-resident programs during the install. To get a list of these, go to Start &gt; Run and type <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;msconfig&nbsp;</span></strong> where it says "<em>Open:</em>"
 then click OK. When the System Configuration Utility appears, click on 
the Startup tab. The only really necessary programs that need to be 
loaded in memory at startup are those related to your graphics chip 
(typically ATI or NVIDIA). Uncheck everything else, reboot and try 
installing the mod again. There are well-documented issues with 
installing mods while Avast antivirus is running, so make absolutely 
sure all components of Avast are completely disabled.

                    The modding community for the Infinity Engine has been going strong for more than 10 years now, and
                    is the culmination of thousands of unpaid modding hours by fellow fans of the game. Modders produce
                    their best work and players get the best, well-supported mods when we all work together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two big ways to upset this harmony. One is to claim someone else's work as your own. The
                    second is to host and redistribute a mod without permission from the author(s).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be kind to your fellow players and modders. Don't do either.

			<h2>Modding</h2><br>

                <p>The new version is very modular. This makes it not too difficult to add new content for areas.<br>
				Is the area already included in the mod?<br>
				Yes: Just add the new files to the appropriate folders under  :file_folder: bggo/base/... as well. <br>
				No: Open the bggo.tp2 with a text editor and add the name of the area in the corresponding table (&quot;bg1_areas&quot;, &quot;bg2_tob_areas&quot;, &quot;sod_areas&quot;, &quot;bgee_areas&quot;, &quot;bg2ee_areas&quot;). Then the new files will be installed automatically. <br>
				For the naming of the BG1 areas the labeling of EET is taken (BG0100), because the clarity of the area names is easier.<br><br>
				For example, if we want to add new candles to an interior map:<br>
				Create in the  :file_folder: bggo/base/are_patch/... a file with the name ARXXXX_are.tpa where ARXXXX is the name of the area.<br> Copy the code <br>
				<code>PATCH_DEFINE_ARRAY x_coord BEGIN 1235 235 785 END <br>
				PATCH_DEFINE_ARRAY y_coord BEGIN  847 333 753 END <br>
				PATCH_PHP_EACH x_coord AS index =&gt; x BEGIN <br>
				&emsp;    LPM ~DELETE_EXISTING_ANIMATIONS~ <br>
				&emsp;   LPF fj_are_structure <br>
				&emsp;   INT_VAR <br>
				&emsp;  &emsp;      fj_loc_x = $x_coord(&quot;%index%&quot;) <br>
				&emsp;  &emsp;      fj_loc_y = $y_coord(&quot;%index%&quot;) <br>
				&emsp;  &emsp;      fj_schedule = 0b111111111111111111111111 //Hours All <br>
				&emsp;  &emsp;      fj_flags = 0b00000000000000000001000001000011    // Visible, blend colours, not covered by wall, don&#39;t remove in combat <br>
				&emsp;  &emsp;      STR_VAR <br>
				&emsp;  &emsp;      fj_structure_type = animation <br>
				&emsp;  &emsp;      fj_name = FLAME2S <br>
				&emsp;  &emsp;      fj_bam_resref = FLAME2S <br>
				&emsp;   END <br>
				END <br>
				LPM ~CLEAR_ARRAY~</code> <br>
				and add the correct coordinates. Now you have to check if the map appears in the lists of bggo.tp2. If not, you have to add the map to the list. Have a look at the examples in the existing files, there you can see different variants. <br></p>
				<p>Compatibility with other mods is also taken care of. For this you can use the above mentioned ARXXXX_are.tpa or also the ARXXXX_wed.tpa in the  :file_folder: bggo/base/wed_patch/... directory. Depending on what the compatibility requires, you can choose the appropriate files.
				Example:<br>
				TDDz: Here the are files must be patched. So we use for example the BG2900_are.tpa.<br>
				GavinNPC: Here a door must be added to the wed file, so we use the BG3300_wed.tpa.<br></p>
				<p>Also with the searchmap you can prevent overwriting the files by using the SRmap_modding_tool. The ARXXXXSR.2da file created with this tool is always preferred to the corresponding ARXXXXSR.bmp. So only the changed pixels are added to the bmp file.</p>
